(* The main non-64-bit systems we are planning to support are JavaScript and WebAssembly.
   js_of_ocaml is treated as a 32-bit platform with 32-bit native integers. All of the
   external [caml_hash*] implementations are all written assuming these 32-bit native ints
   and so using Int32 on the [Non_immediate] path allows for this change to be a runtime
   noop for native and JavaScript. If we were to make this something like [Int63], which
   intuitively feels like a more consistent choice, we would have to change the
   implementations of all of these pretty foundational hash functions in both js and wasm. *)
